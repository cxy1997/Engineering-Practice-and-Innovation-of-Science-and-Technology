## SJTU EI228 Project
# This project implements a automatic line-tracking drone by mounting a camera over the whole track and using computer vision to generate commands.

- Using opencv2.4.9 + Bluetooth Serial Communitation + MSP430 Microcontroller

# In default:

- The drone is covered with color blue in the front and red in the rear. 

- The map is white in background and a black thick line is used as the track.
