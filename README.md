# Project for SJTU EI228: Engineering Practice and Innovation of Science and Technology-2B
## The automatic line-tracking drone is implemented with a trajectory-planning program that perceives the environment through a fixed camera, uses computer vision to interpret pixels and generate commands, and sends instructions to the drone through serial Bluetooth communication to control the torque of different motors.

- Using opencv2.4.9 + Bluetooth Serial Communitation + MSP430 Microcontroller

## By default:

- The drone is covered with color blue in the front and red in the rear. 

- The map is white in background and a black thick line is used as the track.
