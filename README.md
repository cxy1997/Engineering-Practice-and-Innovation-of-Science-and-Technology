# Project for SJTU EI228: Engineering Practice and Innovation of Science and Technology-2B
## This project implements a automatic line-tracking drone by mounting a camera over the whole track and using computer vision to generate commands.

- Using opencv2.4.9 + Bluetooth Serial Communitation + MSP430 Microcontroller

## By default:

- The drone is covered with color blue in the front and red in the rear.
